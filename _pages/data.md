X-ray data of eROSITA clusters
-------------------

Here are the tables for the electron number density profiles, temperature profiles, gas mass profiles, hydrostatic mass profiles of the 22 eROSITA clusters in Li et al. (2024). 
Download them [here](https://github.com/PengfeiLi0606/pengfeili0606.github.io/raw/master/files/eROClusters.zip). 

Baryonic models for the Milky Way
--------------------------------

Here I include 12 baryonic models for the Milky Way. Both the expected circular velocity and surface mass density are given. Most of these models have a triaxial bar. Their circular velocity and surface mass density are azimuthally averaged. The data will be provided once the paper is published. 

Dark matter halos for 175 late-type galaxies
-------------------------------------------------------------

The catalogue of DM halos for the SPARC galaxies using seven halo models (pISO, Burkert, NFW, Einasto, Lucky13, DC14, coreNFW) considering both $\Lambda$CDM priors and flat priors. The tables are in the [Tarball](https://github.com/PengfeiLi0606/pengfeili0606.github.io/raw/master/files/DMhalos.zip).  
If you use the data, please cite Li et al. (2020, ApJS) at [NASA/ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..247...31L/abstract).
