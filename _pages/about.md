About me
======
I am an assistant professor at the School of Astronomy and Space Science at Nanjing University. Before that I was a Humboldt fellow at Leibnize-Institute for Astrophysics at Potsdam (AIP) in Germany. I obtained my PhD from Case Western Reserve University in August 2020.

Research interests
======
My research interests cover galaxy formation and evolution, dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters, dark matter, tesing gravity, and cosmology. I use a variety of techniques including observational data analysis, statistical analysis of big dataset, numerical calculate and theoretical derivation. Three directions that currently interest me are:

(1) Studying how the interplay between dark matter halos and bayonic disks could affect my understanding of dark matter. 

(2) Measuring the dynamical mass profiles for galaxy cluster using various approaches to study cluster dynamics.

(3) Testing if there exists universal scaling relations, which could uncover underlying regularities during complex physical processes.

Research group

Code
======
The code that calculates the adiabtically compressed dark matter halos is availale at [this website](https://github.com/PengfeiLi0606/compress).

Data
======
Various dataset I generated will be put here...
